# WebDevTutorial

Hey there! Welcome to the RCSA Web Development Committee! We're super excited to have you on our team!
As a WebDev member, you'll be doing a lot of coding, editing, and content mainupulation on our site (http://RCSA.berkeley.edu). In order to get you up to speed on how everything works, we've made this tutorial for you so you can learn at your own pace and have us answer questions as needed. This saves us time and hopefully makes you feel less rushed and confused. 

First things first, we're going to need to get your computer set up with a few new programs and packages. Follow the instructions on this README before init'ing the repo or messing with the files. Even if you've used git before or have programming experience, we'd really appreciate it if you could read through the instructions here. It'll prevent headaches in the future if everyone starts out on the same page :)
